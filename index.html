          <h1>Towards Humanoid Robots OS</h1>
          <p>November 15 - <a href="http://www.humanoids2016.org">HUMANOIDS 2016</a> - Full-day Workshop</p>
        </div>

        <p>The goal of the workshop is to discuss the state of the art and the future of humanoid robot OS. Right when the "browser wars" for robot middleware had seemed to reach an end, blends of young and expert blood with novel and different approaches keep the flame burning. This is a maturing, but still novel area of R&amp;D in robotics, which involves coping with new use cases that include: (i) on-board embedded computing in addition to workstation-class computational resources, (ii) real-time constraints intrinsic to work in humanoid robotics, (iii) multiple robot scenarios, swarms and also simultaneous user groups cohabiting on shared and bridged networks, (iv) maintaining quality of service in the presence of network connectivity issues, (v) efforts to adapt towards industrial standards and improved robustness towards production environments, (vi) increasing interest in robotic cyber-security a.k.a. cryptobotics, and (vii) general philosophy regarding interoperability, flexibility, and reuse of OS resources open new horizons. The proposed theme also involves to jointly deepen our understanding of requirements for a robotics middleware and ultimately humanoids OS, while advancing robotic systems capable of being seamlessly integrated from the works of experts in different fields all required for humanoid robotics.</p>

<p>The workshop will discuss best practices, including intra-process and inter-process design patterns, abstraction layers and reusable APIs, reconfigurable build systems, documentation and configuration files, robot 3D and kinematic model descriptions, and novel forms of managing single processing units as well as full clusters. Robotic middleware have proved to extend way beyond the classical issue of remote procedure calls, extending from compatibility layers across existing OS towards advanced graphical launch, monitoring and analysis tools useful for humanoid robotics as well as automated intelligent deployment of computational resources.</p>

<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>Robotic middlewares</li>
<li>Real-time constraints</li>
<li>Humanoid robot control</li>
<li>Paradigms of connectivity</li>

<li>Build systems and abstraction layers</li>
<li>Documentation and configuration</li>
<li>Intelligent automated deployment</li>
<li>Cluster management</li>
</ul>
