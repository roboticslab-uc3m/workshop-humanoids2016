  "body": "The goal of the workshop is to discuss the state of the art and the future of humanoid robot OS. Right when the \"browser wars\" for robot middleware had seemed to reach an end, blends of young and expert blood with novel and different approaches keep the flame burning. This is a maturing, but still novel area of R&D in robotics, which involves coping with new use cases that include: (i) on-board embedded computing in addition to workstation-class computational resources, (ii) real-time constraints intrinsic to work in humanoid robotics, (iii) multiple robot scenarios, swarms and also simultaneous user groups cohabiting on shared and bridged networks, (iv) maintaining quality of service in the presence of network connectivity issues, (v) efforts to adapt towards industrial standards and improved robustness towards production environments, (vi) increasing interest in robotic cyber-security a.k.a. cryptobotics, and (vii) general philosophy regarding interoperability, flexibility, and reuse of OS resources open new horizons. The proposed theme also involves to jointly deepen our understanding of requirements for a robotics middleware and ultimately humanoids OS, while advancing robotic systems capable of being seamlessly integrated from the works of experts in different fields all required for humanoid robotics.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will discuss best practices, including intra-process and inter-process design patterns, abstraction layers and reusable APIs, reconfigurable build systems, documentation and configuration files, robot 3D and kinematic model descriptions, and novel forms of managing single processing units as well as full clusters. Robotic middleware have proved to extend way beyond the classical issue of remote procedure calls, extending from compatibility layers across existing OS towards advanced graphical launch, monitoring and analysis tools useful for humanoid robotics as well as automated intelligent deployment of computational resources.\r\n\r\nTopics of interest include (but are not limited to):\r\n\r\n- Robotic middlewares\r\n- Real-time constraints\r\n- Humanoid robot control\r\n- Paradigms of connectivity\r\n- Quality of service and cryptobotics\r\n- Build systems and abstraction layers\r\n- Documentation and configuration\r\n- Intelligent automated deployment\r\n- Cluster management\r\n\r\nInvited speakers will introduce re-known OS/framework, ranging from overall-glimpses for the curious to tutorials for hands-on oriented attendees.\r\n\r\n### Open Call Submission information\r\n\r\nAn call for participants is open, whom are invited to submit a contribution as an Extended Abstract of maximum 2 pages in length. A video contribution may be added to your submission. Selected contributions will be presented during the workshop as spotlight talks. Related Posters can be placed as additional support for interactions.\r\n\r\nAll submissions will be reviewed using a single-blind review process. Submissions must be sent in PDF, following the IEEE conference style (two-columns), emailed directly to jcgvicto_AT_uc3m_DOT_uc3m_DOT_es indicating [Humanoids 2016 Workshop] in the e-mail subject.\r\n\r\n### Important dates\r\n\r\n- September 30, 2016 - Submission of Extended Abstract deadline\r\n- October 7, 2016 - Notification of acceptance\r\n- October 14, 2016 - Camera-ready deadline\r\n- November 15, 2016 - Workshop\r\n\r\n### Organizers\r\n\r\n- Juan G Victores, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M), Spain\r\n- Lorenzo Natale, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Italy\r\n- Eiichi Yoshida, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan\r\n",
